Hyper Charging+ v1.1

This update focuses on improving charging stability, thermal behavior, and real world consistency.

Changes and improvements
• Added a multi step thermal ladder for smoother current scaling
• Charging power now adapts more gradually as temperature rises
• Improved stability during long charging sessions
• Reduced sudden current drops under moderate heat
• Improved behavior across different chargers and cables
• Minimum current floor maintained when conditions are safe
• Safer handling near higher temperature ranges
• Charging loop tuned for consistentency

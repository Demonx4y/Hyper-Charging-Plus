description=Adaptive fast-charging control module that adjusts charging current based on battery temperature and charging state. Requests higher current in cooler conditions and progressively reduces current as temperature rises to maintain stability and safety. operates using standard kernel power supply interfaces and works alongside existing charging protocols, with final charging behavior always governed by hardware, charger, and thermal limits.
